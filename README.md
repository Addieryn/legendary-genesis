## Board

### Design
- grid based map
- 5 X 5 (alt boards)


## Dice 

### Rules
**ATTACKS**
- dice as modifiers
<!-- - 3 d4 modifiers with plus, minus, crit hit, crit miss
    - majority wins:
```
    1. + + - = + (+1)
    2. + + C = + (+1)
    3. + + + = + (+2)
    4. - - - = - (-2)
    5. - - + = - (-1)
    6. - - C = - (-1)
    7. + - C = 0 (0)
    8. C C -/+ = C (+/- 3{2})
    9. C C C = C+/- (+4/miss)
``` -->
- "+ = +2"
- "- = -2"
- "neutral = no change"
- "crit hit = (?)+4(breaks shield for standard dmg)"
- "crit miss = miss"


**MOVE**
- move to any adjacent space with an terrain (8 ways)
- unless creature is there, or terrain says otherwise (possible abilities can use movement swaps)

## Design
**D20**
```
4 sides = -
4 sides = +
8 sides = neutral (do something with neutral)
1 side = crit hit (might have a chance for counter attack)
1 side = crit miss
```

## UI for game
(?)miniatures in game and 3d assets not just cards
