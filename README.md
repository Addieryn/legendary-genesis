# GAMEPLAY
- single player (maybe you can set up dungeons to fight preset monsters by flipping a cards
- multiplayer (main turn based)
- game modes-
  1. stacking environment for higher level cost cards

## Rules
- place card x1, move(?)rotate card x1, spells unlimited, 1 event if owned (?)instead of spells
- most "tamed" wins
- (?)cards played in any direction
- (?)game ends when all environments are played(timer)
- (?) first creature cant me tamed/gains block for 1 turn

## Card mechanics

### Design
- square cards
- four numbers (?)2 numbers atk/def
- flippable creatures for attack aode and defense side (possibly a creature token deck and summon cards?
- (?)either defense or attack numbers color or symbol coded
- card effects

### Creatures
- directional card damage
- (?)attack and defense
- (?)abilities
   1. (?)move enemy card **ETB**
   2. (?)block (one turn) **ETB**
   3. (?)movement self 
   4. (?)double strike (advantage/reroll) **ETB**
   5. (?)range 
   6. 
   7. 

### Spells
- one time use
- can alter/move creatures
  1. teleport
  2. 

### Commander
- user's character
- (?)abilities
- lower tier of event (like a teaser)
   

### Events
- changes to the field
- event cards are a part of the player deck limit (?)3
  1. draft (draw 5 cards and if creature must be played)
- have to have commander on field

### environment cards
- draw every turn and must play anywhere

*needs to be bigger then creature cards to read/ or written on sides*
- certain effects apply to all creatures placed or moved onto space


## Board

### Rules
- must play creature on an environment


### Design
- grid based map
- 5 X 5 (alt boards)

### Setup
- (?)possible preset places / terrains / encounters
- maybe they act like a roguelike where each playthrough is different

## Dice 

### Rules
**ATTACKS**
- dice as modifiers
<!-- - 3 d4 modifiers with plus, minus, crit hit, crit miss
    - majority wins:
```
    1. + + - = + (+1)
    2. + + C = + (+1)
    3. + + + = + (+2)
    4. - - - = - (-2)
    5. - - + = - (-1)
    6. - - C = - (-1)
    7. + - C = 0 (0)
    8. C C -/+ = C (+/- 3{2})
    9. C C C = C+/- (+4/miss)
``` -->
- "+ = +2"
- "- = -2"
- "neutral = no change"
- "crit hit = (?)+4(breaks shield for standard dmg)"
- "crit miss = miss"


**MOVE**
- move to any adjacent space with an environment (8 ways)
- unless creature is there, or environment says otherwise (possible abilities can use movement swaps)

## Design
**D20**
```
4 sides = -
4 sides = +
8 sides = neutral (do something with neutral)
1 side = crit hit (might have a chance for counter attack)
1 side = crit miss
```
## UI for game
(?)miniatures in game and 3d assets not just cards


## dlc
(?)expansions by environments/region
